## 7.0

### IMPORTANT NOTE

7.0 Represents a major change for Magic "under the hood", and is hopefully the beginning of a more flexible framework for the future.

However, this means that the initial release of 7.0 could potentially have issues and should be considered semi-experimental.
I've tried my best to test it as much as I could, but with a plugin as configurable as Magic there is always the possibility
that I've missed some use-case or that it won't work quite right with your configs.

So please, if at all possible, when upgrading to 7.0 do some testing with your configs in a controlled environment, or at least
make sure to backup MC player data and Magic player data first. Note that without backups it will be *very difficult* to
downgrade from 7.0, as wand data will migrate to player data, and older versions won't know what to do with it.

If you are using completely customized configs there shouldn't be much change, I'm hoping everything will work the same as before.

If you are using the default configs or inheriting from them, everything should *appear* the same as before. However, things
are going to work a little differently behind the scenes.

Magic is evolving past a custom items and spells plugin, and hopefully will become more like the RPG framework that, I think,
many users have always wanted it to be.

For now what this mainly means is that you can configure how data is stored, instead of it always being stored on the wand items.

The default wands are now set up to store mana, spells and a few other attributes to the owning player. This means that
player progression is now tied to the player, not the wand. 

If a player were to craft a new wand, they will see it has their mana and spells on it.

Mana and spells are shared between the Wand, Master Sword and Spell Book, so players are free to mix and match and choose
their own play style without having to re-earn the same spells over and over.

The war configs also make use of this new setup, allowing players to increase their "skill" with certain weapons.

Potter and stars configs have not yet been converted, but they will be, probably in the next release. 
Mana and spells will be stored in separate classes, so that configs can still be mixed together and make sense.

In the future I hope to expand on all of this with a class system in the new "rpg" configs. This isn't ready yet, however,
but I have been working on these changes for so long, now that they seem functional and stable I wanted to get them out there.

I hope you enjoy! Please let me know if you run into any issues.
