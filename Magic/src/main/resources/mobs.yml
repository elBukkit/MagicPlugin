# General format:
#
# <mobkey>:
#       enabled: true/false
#       type: <mob type enum/name>
#       health: 100

#
# Examples:
# Note that a "#" character means the line is commented out and has no effect.
# Make sure to not comment out the lines you add, there should not be a space in front of the name, indentation is important.
# Use http://www.yamllint.com if you have issues with your config, make sure not to use tabs!
