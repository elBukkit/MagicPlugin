override_resource_pack_plugins: false

# This will delay sending resource packs to players. This can mitigate issues with the vanilla

# Set this to true to turn on the player skull-based spell icons
# This may be needed if you have disabled the RP, spell icons are in the RP.
url_icons_enabled: false

# This should get set automatically based on your version, but if you want to override this
# you can.
# This will use the "legacy_icon" field in wands and spells, which generally use damage-based
# icons rather than custom model data icons
legacy_icons_enabled: false

# Set this to revert to pre 10.9 item-based icons, rather than skulls
# This only changes the items used for spell icons. If you want to use the previous

# Set this to allow Magic to periodically check for updates to the resource pack.
# Setting this to false is the same as setting resource_pack_check_interval to 0.

# Set this to true, and resource packs will not be sent to payers on join, instead they will be prompted
# It is not really recommended to use this anymore, the default behavior will prompt players and allow them
# to control their own RP behaviors.
resource_pack_prompt: false

# Similar to the above command, this turns automatic resource packs off by default
# Players can turn it back on using `/getrp auto`

# Goes to the action bar and will tell them to use `/getrp`

# This turns on the wand GUI and any other features that rely on the resource pack,

# Using this is not advised, unless you are really sure that *all* of your players
# are getting and using the resource pack by some other means.
