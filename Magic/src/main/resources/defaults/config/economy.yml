### Economy Helpers

# These values are used to help create a balanced economy if you plan on selling wands, spells, or upgrades.
# Currently they are only visible on the Magic website, though I plan to incorporate them into the plugin in the near future.
# This will probably appear in the form of a "/magic sell <item>" command. This would work just like "/magic give <item>"
# except it would also give you the "worth" of the item as defined by your economy.

# This may be a simple chat message for balance-based economies (e.g. MSRP: $1,000), or it may
# give you physical items for an item-based economy. See the "worth_items" section below.

# The following modifiers affect wand pricing.
# A wand's price is calculated using the sum of the prices of all of its spells as a base.
# Wand properties  (mana, protection, etc) may also add value.
# Each of these values is multiplied by the wand property. Keep in mind that most properties naturally scale
# from 0-1, with some exceptions like mana regeneration and limits. Refer to the maximums set above (e.g. max_mana)
# for a good idea of how those values are going to scale.

# These numbers may look a little screwy,
# I was going for a base-2 kind of thing to hopefully make
# costs fall along even item stack limits. (64)

# This can be used to change how selling items works, by default you get 50% of the item's worth for selling.

# A wand may have additional value for each brush it contains
# Brushes are currently not able to have specific values, though this may be a future addition.
# Some brushes, like copy and clone, are tremendously more powerful than others, like dirt, and hence
# should be more valuable.
worth_brush: 32

# The following are added in if the wand has the specific property at all, they do not scale.
worth_effect_color: 2
worth_effect_particle: 4
worth_effect_sound: 8

# This will be used as a base multiplier for all values. Once spells and wand properties are balanced relative
# to each other (which will hopefully be the default...) you can use this to scale the overall worth of Magic
# items relative to the rest of your economy.
#
# If you have a default Gringott's install, you may want to change this to "0.01" to make the emeralds
# match up.
worth_base: 1

# Here you can define custom currencies
# These can be named in the "currency" section of messages.yml, see the potter example configs for details.
