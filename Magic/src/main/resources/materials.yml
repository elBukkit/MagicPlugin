# Modify this file to change the behavior of various materials.
#
# You can also add individual files to the materials/ folder
#
# This controls how magic deals with individual materials in a variety of ways,
# such as which are indestructible, destructible, transparent, etc.
#
# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/Magic/src/main/resources/defaults/materials
#
# For customization help see: 
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Customization
#
# You only need to edit this file if you want to change the default configuration.
#

#
# Examples:
# Note that a "#" character means the line is commented out and has no effect.
# Make sure to not comment out the lines you add, there should not be a space in front of the name, indentation is important.
# Use http://www.yamllint.com if you have issues with your config, make sure not to use tabs!
