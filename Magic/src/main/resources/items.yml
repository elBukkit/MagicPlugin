# Modify this file to change, add or disable custom item types.
# These items are not wands and don't have any non-vanilla data attached.
#
# You can also add individual files to the items/ folder
#
# See the following folder for the current builtin items:
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/Magic/src/main/resources/defaults/items
#
# For customization help see:

#
# You can also specify the worth of items in this file, so that all shops
# can be balanced by using the same costs as described here.
#
# Items defined in here may be given in-game with the /mgive command
#

#
# General format:
#
# <itemkey>:
#   item: <item type, itemkey used if omitted>
#   worth: currency value per item
#

# Examples:
# Note that a "#" character means the line is commented out and has no effect.
# Make sure to not comment out the lines you add, there should not be a space in front of the name, indentation is important.
